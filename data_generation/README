(1) Script 'extract_features.py' contains methods which extract features from the given time-series data.

	Input of each method is: 
			file_path      = file path to .edf file which contains time-series data.
			interval_size  = time-series are divided into intervals of the same length and
					 feature extraction is performed on each interval [unit=secs]

	Output of each method is:
			features       = matrix: intervals x features 
					 (for each interval we get set of corresponding features)

	Currently implemented methods:
			fourier_features = extracts features from fourier spectrum in a classical way, 
					   as described here: link.
					   So far we use only EEG1 signal which gives us 6 features 
					   and EMG signal which gives us 1 feature.

The methods from this script are called from the following script.

(2) Script 'make_csv.py' is used to create a data set in .csv format which is used for learning and validation.
This is the main script to be called when data sets are created. Depending on the design of experiment, which 
can be edited inside the script, different kind of .csv files will be generated.
